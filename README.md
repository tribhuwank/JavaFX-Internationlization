# JavaFX Internationalization 

This is aboout to make a JavaFX appliation to have text font support the Unicode (UTF-8)  or language like Myanmar and have a functionality to change switch language between given language range like Enlish to Myanamar and vice-versa.


Issue:

In this code everthing is fine except the font visiblity that is not the font as Expected for Myanamar language settings once it is provided dynamically using Internationalization of text property in .fxml file but works fine if text is in static.
