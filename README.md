# JavaFX Internationalization 
This is about making a JavaFX application to have text font support the Unicode (UTF-8) or language like Myanmar and have a functionality to change switch language between giving language range like English to Myanmar and vice-versa.


Issue:
In this code, everything is fine except the font visibility that is not the font as Expected for Myanmar language settings once it is provided dynamically using Internationalization of text property in.Fxml file but works fine if text is static.
